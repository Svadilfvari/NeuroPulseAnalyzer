# NeuroPulse Analyzer: The Pulse Of Tomorrow.

## Development of a Control Strategy for Spinal Cord Stimulation to Improve Walking Movements

Welcome to the NeuroPulse Analyzer project! This project is focused on enhancing walking movements through spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and refining these strategies using machine learning. It aims to improve muscle recruitment selectivity with transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) and develop software to control neurostimulation and analyze electromyography (EMG) signals.

## Overview

### Objectives
Control Strategy Development: Create effective control strategies for spinal cord stimulation to enhance walking movements.
Machine Learning Integration: Utilize machine learning to refine and optimize control strategies.
Muscle Recruitment Selectivity: Improve muscle recruitment selectivity using tSCS.
Software Development: Develop "NeuroPulse Analyzer" for controlling neurostimulation and analyzing EMG signals.

###  Project Background
This project is conducted in the prestigious laboratories of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). The primary goal is to leverage advanced neurostimulation techniques and machine learning to improve walking movements in individuals with spinal cord injuries.

### Features

Neurostimulation Control: Advanced algorithms to control spinal cord stimulation.
EMG Signal Analysis: Detailed analysis of EMG signals to assess muscle responses.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of machine learning models to refine neurostimulation strategies.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use software interface for researchers and clinicians.
