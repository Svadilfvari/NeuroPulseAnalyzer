# NeuroPulse Analyzer: The Pulse Of Tomorrow

## Development of a Control Strategy for Spinal Cord Stimulation to Improve Walking Movements

Welcome to the NeuroPulse Analyzer project! This initiative is dedicated to advancing walking movements through spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and enhancing these strategies using machine learning. Our aim is to refine muscle recruitment selectivity with transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) and develop sophisticated software for neurostimulation control and electromyography (EMG) signal analysis.

## Overview

### Objectives
- **Control Strategy Development**: Design effective control strategies for spinal cord stimulation to improve walking movements.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Employ StimulAI, our machine learning model, to optimize and refine these control strategies.
- **Muscle Recruitment Selectivity**: Enhance muscle recruitment selectivity using tSCS.
- **Software Development**: Create the "NeuroPulse Analyzer" software for precise neurostimulation control and detailed EMG signal analysis.

### Project Background
Conducted at the prestigious laboratories of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), this project aims to leverage cutting-edge neurostimulation techniques and machine learning to significantly improve walking capabilities in individuals with spinal cord injuries.

### Features

- **Neurostimulation Control**: Utilize advanced algorithms to regulate spinal cord stimulation effectively.
- **EMG Signal Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of EMG signals to evaluate muscle responses and optimize stimulation.
- **StimulAI Machine Learning Models**: Implement StimulAI to refine neurostimulation strategies based on real-time data and outcomes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop an intuitive software interface for ease of use by researchers and clinicians.
